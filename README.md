# Starfish Evolution Simulator

A Python simulation demonstrating natural selection in a fictional starfish population over 10 generations.

## What It Does
- Simulates two populations: small starfish and big starfish
- Small starfish have lower chance of being spotted by predators (20% vs 50%)
- Each generation, survivors reproduce and traits pass to offspring
- Shows how survival advantages lead to population changes over time

## How It Works
1. Starts with 100 small and 100 big starfish
2. Each generation:
   - Predators hunt (big starfish more likely to be caught)
   - Survivors reproduce (0-3 babies each)
   - Babies become the next generation
3. Runs for 10 generations or until extinction

## Sample Output
```
Generation-1
245 small Starfishes
52 big Starfishes

Generation-2
589 small Starfishes
18 big Starfishes
...
```

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Natural selection and evolution
- Predator-prey dynamics
- Genetic trait inheritance
- Random simulation with probability

## How to Run
```bash
python starfish_evolution.py
```

Created while learning Python and exploring evolutionary biology concepts through code.
